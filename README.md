### Hi, I'm Dolev <img width="36px" height="36px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" />

I'm a full-stack developer who loves the terminal.

I try to make the terminal experience better every day and that led me to create:
- [`dash`](https://gh-dash.dev) - a beautiful dashboard that let's you fly through your GitHub 🚀
- [`enhance`](https://gh-dash.dev/enhance) - a blazingly fast terminal UI for GitHub Actions
- [`diffnav`](https://github.com/dlvhdr/diffnav) - a git diff pager based on delta but with a file tree, à la GitHub.

If you love what I'm working on, consider:
- Joining my [Insiders Program](https://gh-dash.dev/insiders) 🌟 and get access to exclusive apps
- [Sponsoring me!](https://github.com/sponsors/dlvhdr) ❤️

This allows me to keep working on those libraries and tools and also create new ones.
